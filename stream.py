The Analytics Department at Ola is addressing the challenge of driver churn, a prevalent issue in the ride-hailing industry. 
High driver turnover, exacerbated by the competitive landscape, can impact operational efficiency and incur significant acquisition costs for new drivers. 
As a data scientist in the department, the focus is on predicting driver attrition. 
The monthly data for a subset of drivers from 2019 and 2020 is analyzed to build a predictive model, 
aiding in the identification of factors influencing driver retention and informing strategies to mitigate churn.
